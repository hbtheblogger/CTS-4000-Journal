## **Abstract:**
*Going Beyond The Intended* is a creative digital storytelling project done using a software program called **Twine**. This is a choose-your-own-pathway story in which you select 
1 of 2 characters (Dave or Helen Choat) to give you a tour of a barn on their property in Rural Ontario. After taking both tours of the barn, you can contrast the 2 separate 
perspectives of the barn and its role in their rural lifestyle, to see how the appreciation, utility, and purpose of one barn differ between 2 people.
