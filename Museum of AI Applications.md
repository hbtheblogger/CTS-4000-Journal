**Abstract:** This is a twine game in which you get to take a tour of the various applications of AI from the perspective of 3 different people. Each character has a different perspective and level of knowledge about AI. The purpose of this 'tour' is to demonstrate the importance of educating oneself about the risks of AI and how being aware of the potential unethical uses of it, can allow one to take preventative actions. This project has a slight focus on the unethical applications of AI within the artistic field by exploring the challenges it presents to a specific artist, Greg Rutowski.  

**Bio:** My name is Scott Bracey and I am a fourth-year student in the Culture and Technology Studies program at the University of Guelph, with another minor in Philosophy. I completed this project during my first year in the program, and although I have gotten significantly better at writing since then, I still consider this to be one of my best and most creative projects. This project was assigned in the CTS 1000 class, the first course I completed in the CTS program and it played a big part in my realization that I definitely chose the best program for my skillset.
